# Auto-Close Camera Feature - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### Auto-Close Camera After 3 Photos
**File Modified**: `frontend/src/components/emergency/MediaCapture.js`

Added automatic camera closure when the maximum number of photos (3) is captured:

```javascript
// After capturing a photo
const newPhotoCount = photos.length + 1;
setPhotos(prev => [...prev, newPhoto]);
toast.success(`Photo ${newPhotoCount} captured!`);

// Auto-close camera after capturing max photos
if (newPhotoCount >= maxPhotos) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    stopCamera();
    toast.success(`${maxPhotos} photos captured! Camera closed.`);
  }, 500);
}
```

### How It Works
1. **User opens camera** ‚Üí Camera starts with live video preview
2. **Captures photo 1** ‚Üí Toast: "Photo 1 captured!"
3. **Captures photo 2** ‚Üí Toast: "Photo 2 captured!"
4. **Captures photo 3** ‚Üí Toast: "Photo 3 captured!" + "3 photos captured! Camera closed."
5. **Camera automatically closes** after 500ms delay (allows toast to be visible)

### User Experience
- ‚úÖ Camera shows live video preview with "Live" badge
- ‚úÖ Capture button is clearly visible
- ‚úÖ Each photo capture shows success notification
- ‚úÖ After 3rd photo, camera automatically closes with notification
- ‚úÖ All 3 photos remain available in the carousel below
- ‚úÖ User can still upload photos from device (total limit is 3)
- ‚úÖ User can still record/upload audio

## ‚úÖ Media Upload Verification

### Media Upload Flow (Already Implemented)
**File**: `frontend/src/components/pages/EmergencyPage.js`

When user clicks an emergency service button:

1. **Alert Creation**
   - Creates alert with emergency type and location
   - Gets unique `alert_id` from backend

2. **Media Upload** (if media captured)
   ```javascript
   if (capturedMedia.hasMedia) {
     await fetch('http://localhost:8000/alerts/upload_media', {
       method: 'POST',
       body: JSON.stringify({
         alert_id: alertId,
         photos: capturedMedia.photos,    // All captured photos
         audio: capturedMedia.audio        // Recorded audio
       })
     });
   }
   ```

3. **Success Notification**
   - Shows: "üöì Police alert sent with 3 photo(s) and audio!"
   - Or: "üöì Police alert sent with 3 photo(s) and no audio!"

### Backend Processing (Already Implemented)
**File**: `backend/media_service.py`

- Saves photos as JPG files in `media/photos/`
- Saves audio as WEBM files in `media/audio/`
- Creates metadata.json entries for each file
- Returns URLs: `/media/photos/alert_123_photo_1.jpg`
- Auto-deletes files after 30 minutes

### Admin Dashboard Display (Already Implemented)
**File**: `frontend/src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.js`

In the "Active Alerts" section, alerts with media show:
- **üìé Evidence Attached:** label
- Photo thumbnails (80x80px, clickable for full-size view)
- Inline audio player with play controls
