# SOS Emergency Response — Initial Research

Date: 2025-10-08

Summary (one page)

Existing solutions
- RapidSOS: highly-integrated emergency data platform used by PSAPs (911 centers) to receive telematics and sensor data. Strong on integrations with carriers, OEMs, and public safety answering points.
- Noonlight (formerly SafeTrek): mobile personal safety app that uses verified emergency triggers and connects to dispatchers. Focus on end-user app and verified signal chain.
- bSafe, Kitestring, ROAR: consumer apps providing SOS, location-sharing, and safe-route features.
- Google SOS Alerts / Warnings: provides public alerts and crisis info layers in Maps search and emergency announcements.

Gaps and opportunities
- Verified, coordinated responder matching in real-time: many consumer apps focus on signaling but not automated assignment of NGOs/volunteers/official responders with SLA guarantees.
- False/duplicate alert filtering at scale: preventing spam and malicious triggers requires multi-signal verification (OTP, behavior patterns, device telemetry, cross-user corroboration).
- Privacy-preserving trace data: balancing traceability for responders and user privacy (time-limited, purpose-limited sharing, encryption-at-rest and in-transit).
- Route safety that blends crowd density and official crime/incident reports: few apps combine live crowd-sourced density, public safety feeds, and ML-based route risk estimates.
- Admin-side orchestration and analytics: lightweight admin/authority portals to delegate and auto-assign responders with heatmaps and false-alert trend analysis.

Key design goals for our prototype
- Real-time mapping of geolocated SOS alerts and responder locations.
- Role-based access (user, volunteer/NGO/doctor/police, admin) with admin-managed roles.
- Strong verification: OTP for critical actions, logging of attempts, and simple anomaly heuristics to filter fake alerts.
- Privacy-by-design: encrypt data at rest, limit trace access to authorized roles, and retention policies.
- Extensible architecture to plug in ML anomaly detection, public-safety feeds, and push-notification systems.

APIs and free integrations to consider for prototype
- Google Maps Platform (Maps JS, Directions, Places) — free tier available for dev; required for map UX and routing.
- Firebase Authentication (phone OTP) — simple to integrate, free quota that is good for demo; or mock OTP for local dev.
- Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore (optional) — built-in realtime and presence features for prototypes.
- PostgreSQL (hosted on free-tier cloud providers or local) — relational data for analytics and role management.
- Redis — for caching, short-lived tokens and pub/sub for websockets.
- OpenStreetMap / OpenRouteService — alternatives for routing and map tiles if Google billing is a concern.
- Public safety datasets: local government alerts (CAP feeds), police crime APIs (varies by city) for route safety.

Conclusion

There are mature products in the emergency-safety space, but there's a practical space for a verified, privacy-first coordinator connecting civilians to volunteers/NGOs plus admin orchestration and ML-backed fake-alert filtering. The prototype will demonstrate core flows (OTP, geolocation, auto-assignment, safe-route) and an architecture that can scale to production.
