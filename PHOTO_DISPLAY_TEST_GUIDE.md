## 📊 Expected Backend Logs

When you send alert with media, backend should show:
```
INFO: POST /alerts HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Saved photo to: media/photos/alert_<id>_photo_1.jpg
Saved photo to: media/photos/alert_<id>_photo_2.jpg
Saved photo to: media/photos/alert_<id>_photo_3.jpg
Saved audio to: media/audio/alert_<id>_audio.webm
INFO: POST /alerts/upload_media HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Photos don't appear in Active Alerts

**Check 1: Did photos upload?**
```javascript
// In browser console on Emergency Page after sending alert
console.log('Media captured:', capturedMedia);
// Should show: { photos: [3 items], audio: {...}, hasMedia: true }
```

**Check 2: Are photo_urls in alert object?**
```javascript
// In browser console on Admin Dashboard
console.log('Active alerts:', activeAlerts);
// Look for photo_urls array in alert object
```

**Check 3: Backend received photos?**
```powershell
# Check if media files exist
dir D:\SOS\backend\media\photos
dir D:\SOS\backend\media\audio
```

**Check 4: Backend serving static files?**
- Open: `http://localhost:8000/media/photos/`
- Should see directory listing or 404 (not 500 error)

### Problem: Broken image icon appears

**Solution 1: Check file exists**
```powershell
# Photo URL from alert: /media/photos/alert_123_photo_1.jpg
# Check if file exists:
Test-Path "D:\SOS\backend\media\photos\alert_123_photo_1.jpg"
```

**Solution 2: Check backend static mount**
- Backend should have: `app.mount("/media", StaticFiles(directory="media"), name="media")`
- Restart backend if needed

### Problem: "Evidence Attached" section doesn't show

**Reason**: Alert has no photos or audio
- Check: `alert.photo_urls?.length > 0` or `alert.audio_url` exists
- The section only shows if media exists

---

## 📁 File Structure

After sending alert with media:
```
D:\SOS\backend\
├── media/
│   ├── photos/
│   │   ├── alert_123_photo_1.jpg  ← Your photos
│   │   ├── alert_123_photo_2.jpg
│   │   └── alert_123_photo_3.jpg
│   └── audio/
│       └── alert_123_audio.webm   ← Your audio
└── metadata.json                  ← Media metadata
```
