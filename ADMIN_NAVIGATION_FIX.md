# Admin Navigation Fix - Removed User Dashboard from Admin Panel

## Problem
When admins clicked on "Dashboard" in the navigation, they were being directed to the user dashboard (purple background with SOS button, location status, etc.) instead of the admin-specific alerts management dashboard.

## Root Cause
In `frontend/src/components/layout/Header.js`, the navigation items were configured incorrectly:
- The "Dashboard" link pointed to `/dashboard` for all users including admins
- This route redirects to `/user-dashboard` which shows the citizen/user interface
- Admins should see `/admin-dashboard` instead

## Solution
Updated `Header.js` to properly route users based on their role:

### Changes Made:

1. **Added Dynamic Dashboard Path Function**
   ```javascript
   const getDashboardPath = () => {
     if (user?.role === 'admin') return '/admin-dashboard';
     if (user?.role === 'responder') return '/responder';
     return '/user-dashboard';
   };
   ```

2. **Updated Navigation Items**
   - **Before:** One "Dashboard" link for all roles pointing to `/dashboard`
   - **After:** Role-specific navigation:
     - Citizens: "Dashboard" → `/user-dashboard`
     - Responders: "Responder" → `/responder` (dashboard is their responder view)
     - Admins: "Admin" → `/admin-dashboard`

3. **Updated Logo Link**
   - Changed from static `/dashboard` to dynamic `getDashboardPath()`
   - Now clicking logo takes you to your role-appropriate dashboard

### Code Changes:

**Navigation Items:**
```javascript
// OLD
const navItems = [
  { path: '/dashboard', icon: HomeIcon, label: 'Dashboard', roles: ['citizen', 'responder', 'admin'] },
  { path: '/responder', icon: ShieldCheckIcon, label: 'Responder', roles: ['responder'] },
  { path: '/admin', icon: UserGroupIcon, label: 'Admin', roles: ['admin'] },
];

// NEW
const navItems = [
  { path: '/user-dashboard', icon: HomeIcon, label: 'Dashboard', roles: ['citizen'] },
  { path: '/responder', icon: ShieldCheckIcon, label: 'Responder', roles: ['responder'] },
  { path: '/admin-dashboard', icon: UserGroupIcon, label: 'Admin', roles: ['admin'] },
];
```

**Logo Link:**
```javascript
// OLD
<Link to="/dashboard" className="flex items-center space-x-2">

// NEW
<Link to={getDashboardPath()} className="flex items-center space-x-2">
```

## Result

### For Admin Users:
- ✅ Logo → Admin Dashboard (alerts management)
- ✅ "Admin" nav link → Admin Dashboard
- ✅ No access to user dashboard with SOS button
- ✅ Only see admin-specific interface

### For Regular Citizens:
- ✅ Logo → User Dashboard (SOS button, location, quick actions)
- ✅ "Dashboard" nav link → User Dashboard
- ✅ See personal safety interface

### For Responders:
- ✅ Logo → Responder Dashboard
- ✅ "Responder" nav link → Responder Dashboard
- ✅ See emergency response interface
