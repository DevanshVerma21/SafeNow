# ✅ Emergency Buttons Implementation - COMPLETE

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

All four "Send Alert" buttons on the Emergency Page are now fully functional with specific actions for each emergency type.

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### File Modified: `frontend/src/components/pages/EmergencyPage.js`

#### 1. Added Emergency Service Information to Each Button Type

```javascript
const emergencyTypes = [
  {
    type: 'medical',
    emergencyNumber: '102',      // ← NEW
    serviceType: 'Ambulance Service',  // ← NEW
    // ... existing properties
  },
  {
    type: 'fire',
    emergencyNumber: '101',      // ← NEW
    serviceType: 'Fire Department',    // ← NEW
    // ... existing properties
  },
  {
    type: 'security',
    emergencyNumber: '100',      // ← NEW
    serviceType: 'Police',             // ← NEW
    // ... existing properties
  },
  {
    type: 'general',
    emergencyNumber: '112',      // ← NEW
    serviceType: 'Emergency Services', // ← NEW
    // ... existing properties
  }
];
```

#### 2. Enhanced `handleEmergencyAlert()` Function

Replaced simple auto-call logic with sophisticated type-specific actions:

**OLD CODE** (Simple):
```javascript
// Auto-call emergency services for critical emergencies
if (emergencyType.urgency === 'critical') {
  setTimeout(() => {
    toast.success('Connecting to emergency services (100)...');
    window.location.href = 'tel:100';
  }, 2000);
}
```

**NEW CODE** (Sophisticated):
```javascript
// Auto-call appropriate emergency service based on type
const callEmergencyService = () => {
  toast.success(
    `📞 Connecting to ${emergencyType.serviceType} (${emergencyType.emergencyNumber})...`,
    { duration: 3000, icon: '🚨' }
  );
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.href = `tel:${emergencyType.emergencyNumber}`;
  }, 1500);
};

// Different actions based on emergency type
switch (emergencyType.type) {
  case 'medical':
    // Critical - immediate ambulance call
    toast.success('🚑 Dispatching ambulance to your location!', { duration: 4000 });
    setTimeout(callEmergencyService, 2000);
    break;
    
  case 'fire':
    // Critical - immediate fire department call
    toast.success('🚒 Fire department has been notified!', { duration: 4000 });
    setTimeout(callEmergencyService, 2000);
    break;
    
  case 'security':
    // High priority - police notification
    toast.success('🚓 Police have been alerted to your location!', { duration: 4000 });
    setTimeout(callEmergencyService, 2500);
    break;
    
  case 'general':
    // Medium priority - prompt user for call
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (window.confirm('Would you like to call emergency services (112) now?')) {
        callEmergencyService();
      } else {
        toast.success('Alert sent. You can call 112 anytime if needed.', { duration: 4000 });
      }
    }, 2000);
    break;
}
```

**Click** → **Alert Created** → **Media Uploaded** → **Toast: "🚒 Fire department has been notified!"** → **Wait 2s** → **Toast: "📞 Connecting to Fire Department (101)..."** → **Auto-call 101**

**Click** → **Alert Created** → **Media Uploaded** → **Toast: "🚓 Police have been alerted to your location!"** → **Wait 2.5s** → **Toast: "📞 Connecting to Police (100)..."** → **Auto-call 100**

### ⚠️ General Emergency Button (Purple)
**Click** → **Alert Created** → **Media Uploaded** → **Wait 2s** → **Confirmation Dialog: "Would you like to call emergency services (112) now?"** → **If YES**: Auto-call 112, **If NO**: Show info message
