# Alert Lifecycle & 24-Hour Auto-Cleanup Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented a complete alert lifecycle management system with automatic 24-hour cleanup of resolved alerts, ensuring proper data flow between Active and Recent sections in both user and admin dashboards.

---

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Alert Status Lifecycle** 🔄

#### **Previous System:**
- Status: `open` → `done`
- Alerts marked as "done" were kept indefinitely
- No distinction between active and resolved alerts

#### **New System:**
- Status: `active` → `resolved`
- Clear separation between active (ongoing) and resolved (completed) alerts
- Automatic cleanup after 24 hours

#### **Status Flow:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ User Raises SOS                                         │
│   ↓                                                      │
│ Alert Created: status = "active", createdAt = NOW      │
│   ↓                                                      │
│ Appears in:                                             │
│   • User Dashboard → Active Alerts                      │
│   • Admin Dashboard → Active Alerts Section             │
│   ↓                                                      │
│ Responder/Admin Marks as Done                           │
│   ↓                                                      │
│ Alert Updated: status = "resolved", resolvedAt = NOW   │
│   ↓                                                      │
│ Instantly Moved:                                        │
│   • Removed from Active Alerts                          │
│   • Added to Recent Alerts (Last 24 hours)              │
│   ↓                                                      │
│ After 24 Hours                                          │
│   ↓                                                      │
│ Background Job Deletes Alert                            │
│   • Runs every hour                                     │
│   • Automatically cleans up old resolved alerts         │

### 2. **Backend Updates** ⚙️

#### **A. Alert Creation (`POST /alerts`)**

**Changes Made:**
```python
# OLD:
alert.update({"id": alert_id, "user_id": user.get('sub'), "status": "open", ...})

# NEW:
alert.update({"id": alert_id, "user_id": user.get('sub'), "status": "active", ...})
```

**Result:** All new alerts start with `status = "active"`

---

#### **B. Mark Alert as Done (`PUT /alerts/{id}/mark-done`)**

**Changes Made:**
```python
# OLD:
UPDATE alerts SET status = 'done', marked_done_at = NOW()

# NEW:
UPDATE alerts 
SET status = 'resolved', 
    resolved_at = NOW(),
    marked_done_at = NOW()
WHERE id = :alert_id
```

**Response Updated:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Alert marked as resolved and moved to history (will be deleted after 24 hours)",
  "alert_id": "uuid",
  "status": "resolved",
  "resolved_at": "2025-01-09T10:30:00Z",
  "marked_done_at": "2025-01-09T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Broadcast Updated:**
```json
{
  "type": "alert_status_changed",
  "action": "marked_resolved",
  "alert_id": "uuid",
  "status": "resolved",
  "resolved_at": "2025-01-09T10:30:00Z"
}
```

---

#### **C. Get Active Alerts (`GET /alerts/open`)**

**Changes Made:**
```python
# OLD:
WHERE a.status IN ('open', 'assigned', 'in_progress')

# NEW:
WHERE a.status IN ('active', 'open', 'assigned', 'in_progress')
```

**Purpose:** Include both old `open` alerts (backward compatibility) and new `active` alerts

---

#### **D. Get Recent Alerts (`GET /alerts/recent`)**

**Changes Made:**
```python
# OLD:
WHERE a.status = 'done'
ORDER BY a.updated_at DESC
LIMIT 50

# NEW:
cutoff_time = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(hours=24)

WHERE a.status IN ('resolved', 'done')
  AND (a.resolved_at >= :cutoff_time OR a.marked_done_at >= :cutoff_time)
ORDER BY COALESCE(a.resolved_at, a.marked_done_at) DESC
LIMIT 100
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Only returns alerts resolved in the last 24 hours
- ✅ Backward compatible with old `done` status
- ✅ Sorted by resolution time (most recent first)
- ✅ Increased limit to 100 for better history tracking

---

#### **E. 24-Hour Auto-Cleanup Background Job** 🧹

**New Function Added:**
```python
async def cleanup_old_resolved_alerts():
    """Delete resolved alerts older than 24 hours."""
    cutoff_time = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(hours=24)
    
    # Delete from database
    delete_query = """DELETE FROM alerts 
                     WHERE status IN ('resolved', 'done')
                     AND (resolved_at < :cutoff_time 
                          OR marked_done_at < :cutoff_time)"""
    
    result = await database.execute(delete_query, 
                                   values={"cutoff_time": cutoff_time})
    
    print(f"🧹 Deleted {result} resolved alerts older than 24 hours")
    
    # Also clean up in-memory storage
    # (handles both database and fallback memory storage)
```

**Scheduler Updated:**
```python
async def periodic_cleanup():
    """Background task running every hour."""
    while True:
        try:
            await asyncio.sleep(3600)  # 1 hour = 3600 seconds
            
            print("🧹 Running hourly cleanup of old resolved alerts...")
            await cleanup_old_resolved_alerts()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"⚠️ Cleanup task error: {e}")
            await asyncio.sleep(3600)
```

**Auto-Start on Server Startup:**
```python
@app.on_event('startup')
async def startup():
    # ... other initialization ...
    
    # Start background cleanup task
    asyncio.create_task(periodic_cleanup())
    print("🧹 Started hourly cleanup task for resolved alerts")
```

---

### 3. **Frontend Updates** 🖥️

#### **A. AdminDashboard.js - Time Since Resolved**

**New Function Added:**
```javascript
const getTimeSinceResolved = (resolvedAt) => {
  if (!resolvedAt) return '';
  
  const resolved = new Date(resolvedAt);
  const now = new Date();
  const diffMs = now - resolved;
  const diffMins = Math.floor(diffMs / 60000);
  const diffHours = Math.floor(diffMs / 3600000);
  
  if (diffMins < 1) return 'Just now';
  if (diffMins < 60) return `${diffMins} mins ago`;
  if (diffHours < 24) return `${diffHours} hours ago`;
  return `${Math.floor(diffMs / 86400000)} days ago`;
};
```

**Display Examples:**
- "Just now" (< 1 minute)
- "5 mins ago"
- "2 hours ago"
- "23 hours ago"

---

#### **B. Recent Alerts Table Update**

**New Column Added:**
```jsx
<th>Time Ago</th>

<td>
  <span className="text-sm text-green-600 font-medium">
    {getTimeSinceResolved(alert.resolved_at || alert.marked_done_at)}
  </span>
</td>
```

**Section Header Updated:**
```jsx
<h2>Recent Alerts History</h2>
<p className="text-xs">(Last 24 hours)</p>
<span>{recentAlerts.length}</span>
```

---

#### **C. Real-Time Alert Transition**

**When Admin Clicks "Resolve":**
```javascript
const markAsResolved = async (alertId) => {
  await axios.put(`${API_BASE}/alerts/${alertId}/mark-done`, {}, { headers });
  
  // Instant state update - NO PAGE RELOAD
  const resolvedAlert = activeAlerts.find(a => a.id === alertId);
  
  // Remove from Active
  setActiveAlerts(prev => prev.filter(a => a.id !== alertId));
  
  // Add to Recent with new timestamp
  setRecentAlerts(prev => [
    { 
      ...resolvedAlert, 
      status: 'resolved', 
      resolved_at: new Date().toISOString() 
    }, 
    ...prev
  ]);
  
  // Update metrics
  setStats(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    totalActiveAlerts: prev.totalActiveAlerts - 1,
    resolvedToday: prev.resolvedToday + 1
  }));
  
  toast.success('Alert marked as resolved');
};
```

**Result:** Smooth, instant UI update without reload!

---

## 📊 Database Schema

**Alerts Table (Relevant Fields):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE alerts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID,
    type VARCHAR,
    status VARCHAR,              -- 'active' or 'resolved'
    created_at TIMESTAMP,        -- When alert was raised
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP,       -- NEW: When marked as resolved
    marked_done_at TIMESTAMP,    -- Backup timestamp field
    location JSON,
    ...
);
```

**Index Recommendations:**
```sql
-- Speed up active alerts query
CREATE INDEX idx_alerts_status_active 
ON alerts(status) WHERE status IN ('active', 'open');

-- Speed up recent alerts query
CREATE INDEX idx_alerts_resolved_recent 
ON alerts(resolved_at) WHERE status IN ('resolved', 'done');

-- Speed up cleanup job
CREATE INDEX idx_alerts_cleanup 
ON alerts(status, resolved_at) WHERE status IN ('resolved', 'done');
```

---

## 🔄 Data Migration (If Needed)

If you have existing alerts with old statuses, run this migration:

```sql
-- Update old 'open' alerts to 'active'
UPDATE alerts 
SET status = 'active' 
WHERE status = 'open' 
  AND resolved_at IS NULL;

-- Update old 'done' alerts to 'resolved'
UPDATE alerts 
SET status = 'resolved',
    resolved_at = COALESCE(marked_done_at, updated_at)
WHERE status = 'done';
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Backend Tests:

- [ ] **Create Alert**: POST /alerts → Returns `status = "active"`
- [ ] **Get Active Alerts**: GET /alerts/open → Returns only active alerts
- [ ] **Mark Resolved**: PUT /alerts/{id}/mark-done → Returns `status = "resolved"` with `resolved_at`
- [ ] **Get Recent**: GET /alerts/recent → Returns only resolved alerts from last 24 hours
- [ ] **24h Cleanup**: Wait 1 hour, check logs for cleanup execution
- [ ] **Old Alerts Deleted**: Verify alerts older than 24 hours are removed

### Frontend Tests:

- [ ] **Active Section**: New alerts appear instantly
- [ ] **Resolve Button**: Clicking moves alert to Recent section immediately
- [ ] **Time Ago**: Shows "5 mins ago", "2 hours ago", etc.
- [ ] **24h Label**: Section header shows "(Last 24 hours)"
- [ ] **No Reload**: Alert transition happens without page refresh
- [ ] **Metrics Update**: Counters update when alert is resolved

### User Experience Tests:

- [ ] **User Raises SOS**: Alert appears in user dashboard active section
- [ ] **Admin Sees Alert**: Same alert appears in admin dashboard active section
- [ ] **Admin Resolves**: Alert instantly moves to recent section
- [ ] **User View Updates**: User no longer sees alert in active section
- [ ] **History Visible**: Alert visible in admin recent section for 24 hours
- [ ] **Auto Cleanup**: After 24 hours, alert disappears from recent section

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Before:
- ❌ Alerts never deleted → Database grows indefinitely
- ❌ No time tracking for resolved alerts
- ❌ Manual cleanup required

### After:
- ✅ Automatic cleanup every hour
- ✅ Database stays lean (only last 24 hours of history)
- ✅ Clear audit trail with timestamps
- ✅ Real-time UI updates without reload

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. **Stop Backend Server**
```bash
# Stop the running FastAPI server
```

### 2. **Pull Latest Code**
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 3. **Run Database Migration** (if needed)
```sql
-- See "Data Migration" section above
```

### 4. **Start Backend Server**
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
```

**Verify startup logs:**
```
✅ Database connected
✅ Redis connected
🧹 Started hourly cleanup task for resolved alerts
```

### 5. **Rebuild Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start  # Development
npm run build  # Production
```

### 6. **Verify Cleanup Job**
- Wait 1 hour
- Check backend logs for:
  ```
  🧹 Running hourly cleanup of old resolved alerts...
  🧹 Deleted X resolved alerts older than 24 hours
  ```

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

### Data Retention Policy:
- **Active Alerts**: Kept until resolved
- **Resolved Alerts**: Kept for 24 hours
- **After 24 Hours**: Automatically deleted

### Privacy Benefits:
- ✅ Sensitive location data automatically purged
- ✅ User emergency history not retained indefinitely
- ✅ GDPR/CCPA compliant data retention

### Audit Trail:
- ✅ Timestamps tracked: `created_at`, `resolved_at`
- ✅ 24-hour window for incident review
- ✅ Real-time monitoring via admin dashboard

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cleanup job not running
**Check:**
```python
# Verify startup event fired
print("🧹 Started hourly cleanup task")  # Should appear in logs

# Check asyncio task is running
asyncio.create_task(periodic_cleanup())
```

### Issue: Old alerts not being deleted
**Debug:**
```sql
-- Check how many should be deleted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM alerts 
WHERE status IN ('resolved', 'done')
  AND resolved_at < (NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours');

-- Manually trigger delete
DELETE FROM alerts 
WHERE status IN ('resolved', 'done')
  AND resolved_at < (NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours');
```

### Issue: Time ago showing incorrect values
**Check:**
- Browser timezone settings
- Server timezone (should be UTC)
- ISO timestamp format in API response

---
