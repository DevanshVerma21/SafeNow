# 🔧 Media Capture Fix - Upload from Device Added

## Issue Fixed
❌ **Error**: `TypeError: parameter 1 is not of type 'Blob'`  
✅ **Solution**: Fixed FileReader usage and added device upload functionality

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Photo Capture from Camera
**Problem**: `canvas.toBlob()` callback wasn't properly handling the blob
**Solution**: Added proper error handling and null checks

```javascript
canvas.toBlob((blob) => {
  if (blob) {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onloadend = () => {
      // Success handling
    };
    reader.onerror = (error) => {
      // Error handling
    };
    reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
  }
}, 'image/jpeg', 0.9);
```

### 2. Added Photo Upload from Device
**New Feature**: Users can now upload photos from their device storage

```javascript
const handleFileUpload = (event) => {
  const files = event.target.files;
  // Process up to maxPhotos limit
  // Validate file type (image/*)
  // Validate file size (max 10MB)
  // Convert to base64 data URL
};
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Multiple file selection
- ✅ File type validation (images only)
- ✅ File size validation (max 10MB per file)
- ✅ Respects maxPhotos limit
- ✅ Error messages for invalid files

### 3. Added Audio Upload from Device
**New Feature**: Users can now upload audio files from their device

```javascript
const handleAudioUpload = (event) => {
  const file = event.target.files?.[0];
  // Validate audio file type
  // Validate file size (max 10MB)
  // Set as audio blob
};
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Audio file validation
- ✅ File size limit (10MB)
- ✅ Replaces recording if present

### 4. Updated UI with Upload Buttons

```
[Upload Button] [Camera Button]
```
